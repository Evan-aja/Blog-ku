## Week 5

This was a busy week for me as I had to travel back to my hometown for some administrative work. While I was there, I had to miss some of the asynchronous materials on dicoding and/or Coursera, but I did attend an ILT session on English class that helped me improve my language skills. The following day, I attended an ILT session on critical thinking, which gave me a new perspective on how to solve real-world issues effectively. Later in the week, I took a day off for a holiday and traveled back to Malang city. The journey was tiring due to the treacherous terrain in the mountains, but it was worth it. I ended the day by tweaking my Linux system for better performance. The next day was the first day of Ramadan, and I started reading material on System Administration on Coursera since I had finished all of the assignments for the week. It was enjoyable to go through the material. To finish off the week, I had my weekly consultation with my mentor. I didn't attend the morning meeting, but I made up for it by attending the late-night replacement meeting. During the meeting, I shared my experiences about my university life, and it was fun to hear other people's differing opinions about their own universities.

## Week 6

I was focused on completing courses on Coursera and GCSB. I started with the Coursera course titled 'System Administration and IT Infrastructure Services' and learned about the basics of System Administration. I also attended an insightful ILT session on building great solutions with compute and network services in Google Cloud. Throughout the week, I continued with the Coursera course, making good progress and completing module 4/6. The course was thorough, although sometimes a bit uninteresting. Finally, I completed the course and found the final test to be quite challenging, but the modules had prepared me well. I also completed the GCSB course, which was about preparing oneself to take on Google's Associate Cloud Engineer. The challenges and real-life study cases were challenging, but I found them fun to work on. Overall, I would rate my experience an 8/10. I'm excited to apply my newfound knowledge in the coming weeks and continue to learn and grow as a System Administrator.

## Week 7

This week was dedicated to completing various courses on Google Cloud Platform. On the first day, I started working on the Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services and managed to finish four submodules. The second day was spent attending an ILT session on Adaptability, which was very informative. The third day was dedicated to completing the Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation course. On the fourth day, I started the final course, Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure, which covers all the basics of Google Cloud Platform. I also had my weekly consultation with my mentor at the end of the day. By the last day of the week, I had completed all my assignments and gained a lot of knowledge from the courses.

## Week 8

It was an exciting week as I had many activities related to my Bangkit Academy cohort. The mandatory student meeting was informative and gave me an insight into the capstone project, which was very helpful. I had the opportunity to form a team, and we explored company expose for company-based capstone projects. It was an excellent opportunity to get a better understanding of the requirements and the available options. I also attended an ILT session on data storage in Google Cloud Platform, which provided me with a deeper understanding of the subject. The weekly consultation session was an excellent opportunity to discuss our progress and any challenges we may be facing. It was helpful to receive feedback and insights from our instructors and peers. In addition to the weekly consultation session, I also had the opportunity to attend a few ILT sessions, which were always insightful and provided me with a deeper understanding of the subject matter. One of the sessions I attended this week was on data storage in Google Cloud Platform, which was particularly helpful for me as a system administrator. The session covered various topics, including Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Bigtable, and Cloud Spanner, and provided me with a deeper understanding of how to choose the right storage solution for my needs.

## Closing

Overall, my experience on the second month at Bangkit Academy was very exciting! I am looking forward to the upcoming weeks and excited to see what new challenges and opportunities lie ahead.
