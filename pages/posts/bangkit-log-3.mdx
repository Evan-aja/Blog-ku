## Week 9

This week was relatively relaxed since there weren't any synchronous events. I spent the first day self-studying and reflecting, taking things easy because Eid was coming up. On the second and third day, I attended optional product-based capstone project presentations. It was interesting to see people's ideas and solutions, and in the afternoon, I had the chance to meet and learn from older Bangkit cohorts who shared their proposals from previous years.

As Eid approached, the campus got quieter, but I kept busy working on asynchronous tasks in Google Cloud Scalable Business (GCSB). On the last day of the week, I finished my tasks in GCSB and felt content with the pace of the week. Despite being slow, it was still exciting by my standards, and I looked forward to enjoying Eid.

## Week 10

This week has been quite enjoyable since it was a holiday, and I spent most of my time at home with my family and friends. However, despite the distractions, I managed to make some progress in my work. I began by reviewing this week's asynchronous tasks and got excited to work on them.

On the first day of the week, I focused on the course "Set up and Configure a Cloud Environment in Google Cloud". I learned a lot about SQL and VPC in Google Cloud Platform, and I was able to make significant progress. I hope to complete the rest of the course by tomorrow.

On the third day of the week, I focused on cloud monitoring and Kubernetes. The topic of Kubernetes was fascinating for me because it is a critical software that many companies use to orchestrate their containers easily. I also completed a challenge lab, where I was able to implement my newly acquired knowledge in a real-world application.

On the fourth day, I began working on the second course, which was about infrastructure automation utilizing Terraform. Although it reminded me of how Ansible works, Terraform is more focused on setting up infrastructure. The way that cloud engineers can create infrastructure as code is incredibly helpful in automating repetitive tasks.

Finally, on the last day of the week, I finished the last course, Automation with Terraform. Initially, it was challenging, but after some time, I found it to be an essential tool that allowed me to manage the cloud in a programmatic and predictable way. I am looking forward to next week's tasks and learning more about cloud engineering.

## Week 11

Monday, the start of a new week and a holiday for International Labor Day. As there were no new activities for the cohort, I spent the day learning Rust language by myself. It was a great opportunity to explore and learn something new.

On Tuesday, I attended the Capstone Product-based Presentation Theme meeting, and there were finally new activities for asynchronous tasks in the classroom. I was excited to start the course "Menjadi Google Cloud Engineer" by dicoding.

Wednesday was another Capstone Product-based Presentation Theme meeting, and I found it very interesting. However, I was more focused on the dicoding class as it had some big projects that I needed to work on.

Thursday started with the weekly consultation session, where I got to meet everyone again. I spent most of the day finishing the dicoding class, and now I am only left with the last project submission. in the middle of working on the tasks, I was also filling the mandatory bi-weekly feedback form for my mentor.

On Friday, I worked with my Capstone team to submit the project plan for the capstone project. I also attended the ILT session on Project Management, which gave me a lot of knowledge about managing projects in a company. Although I had some disagreements over the material provided, it was still helpful in broadening my perspective.

Overall, it was a productive week as I learned new things and made progress in both the dicoding class and capstone project.

## Week 12

This week was filled with exciting activities and accomplishments. On Monday, I attended an ILT session focused on automation and operation services in GCP. The presenter was engaging and provided thorough explanations to all the questions asked by the participants. after the meeting I played around with rclone to do cloud sync for my data.

I finished the day by doing a peer to peer mentoring session with my colleague.

The second day of the week was dedicated to working on asynchronous tasks, specifically the course on Application Development with Cloud Run. I made significant progress, completing several submodules. I'm optimistic about reaching the 2/3 mark by tomorrow.

The following day turned out to be a pleasant surprise as I managed to complete the entire course on Cloud Run. It was a fantastic learning experience, providing valuable insights into cloud-based containerization.

Thursday began with a weekly consultation session with my mentor, where I received guidance and support. However, most of the day was spent discussing a project with my capstone team. We finalized our proposal, and the announcement will be made tomorrow.

Finally, on the last day of the week, our team received excellent news. Our proposal was accepted without any revisions required. We are excited to begin development on the project next week.

## Closing

Overall, my experience on the third month at Bangkit Academy was very exciting! I made progress in various courses and projects, and I am looking forward to the upcoming weeks. The hands-on learning approach and the support from mentors and fellow students have been invaluable in shaping my skills and knowledge. I can't wait to see what new challenges and opportunities lie ahead.
