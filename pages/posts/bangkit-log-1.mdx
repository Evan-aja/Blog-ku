Whether you are interested in **machine learning, mobile development, or cloud computing**, Bangkit Academy can help you achieve your goals and launch a successful career in this exciting field.

## Week 0

During week 0, I attended a technical briefing session by Bangkit, learned pre-work on Dicoding and YouTube videos on Google Cloud Platform, and read some PDFs provided by the Academy. It was an exciting start as I was able to meet new and interesting friends in the Discord server and see who I was working with.

## Week 1

In week 1, I learned about creating a website front-end by using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I learned through Dicoding with my Bangkit email. Towards the end of the week, I attended the first weekly meeting with my mentor and the grand opening of the Bangkit Academy.

It was an amazing experience! I also set up accounts for Coursera and Google Cloud Platform, which will be used for next week's courses and challenges. We also had an ILT session that discussed growth mindset and its importance in making myself a better person and team player.

## Week 2

Week 2 was all about working hard on finishing my Google Cloud Skill Boost courses. I learned a lot about how Google Cloud Platform works, the inner workings of its architecture, pricing considerations, and managing the system. I also learned about AI and Machine Learning and how easy it is to implement and work on this type of challenge in Google Cloud Platform.

However, I faced an issue with my Coursera account, and it took a few days for the Bangkit team to reply to my email.

## Week 3

Week 3 was a wild one! I was anxious about my Coursera course deadline since I still couldn't access the course itself. Eventually, I received an invitation mail to the course, but I also received a message from the Bangkit team about my final grade being affected if I didn't finish the course on time. It was frustrating since I had been waiting for a reply for a week.

On top of that, I got into a motorcycle accident, making this week quite eventful.

## Week 4

Week 4 was a smoother one. I learned about the ins and outs of the **JavaScript** programming language, using it in object-oriented and functional-oriented programming. I also learned about how to use Node.js and how to manage project dependencies and maintenance using npm. I then applied this knowledge to develop a backend web project that runs using **HTTP** requests with REST API.

Dicoding also taught me about how to automate testing on the developed API using Postman, increasing my efficiency in project development. The final project assessment left a bit to be desired due to the use of ESLint, which had a weird code style compared to Code Prettier.
