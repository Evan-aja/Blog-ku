## Gabrielle Evan

Hey, I'm a University Student of Brawijaya University. I mostly work as a Backend developer, Cloud Computing Engineer, or a DevOps Engineer. Primarily works in Linux environment (Arch or RPM based).

In addition to my technical skills, I am also passionate about learning new things and constantly improving my skills. I enjoy working on challenging projects that push me out of my comfort zone and allow me to grow as a developer.
